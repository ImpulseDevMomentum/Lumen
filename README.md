This "language" is very, very simple, so please don't try to code next cyberpunk. 
It was also created based on this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eythq9848Fg&list=PLZQftyCk7_SdoVexSmwy_tBgs7P0b97yD&index (first episode) by CodePulse.

So instead of `ELIF` you have `OTHER` <br>
instead of `RETURN` you have `BACK` <br>
instead of `END` you have `STOP` <br>
instead of `FUN/DEF` you have `FUNC` <br>
instead of `VAR` you have `SET` <br>

To start your own program, just start shell.py and then type RUN("your file with .lum extension")
