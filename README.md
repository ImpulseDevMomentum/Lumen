This "language" was "created" for school purposes. Because of that, it is very, very simple, so please don't try to code next Cyberpunk. 
It was based on this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eythq9848Fg&list=PLZQftyCk7_SdoVexSmwy_tBgs7P0b97yD&index by CodePulse.

Here are some syntax differences:

- instead of `ELIF` you have `OTHER` <br>
- instead of `RETURN` you have `BACK` <br>
- instead of `END` you have `STOP` <br>
- instead of `FUN/DEF` you have `FUNC` <br>
- instead of `VAR` you have `SET` <br>

To start your own program, simply run `shell.py` and then type RUN("your file with **.lum** extension"). The basic code example
is in the **example.lum** or **calc.lum** files; I _probably_ won't include any other examples.

You can also use the shell interactively. For example: 

- `SET b = 5`
- `IF b == 5 THEN PRINT("True") ELSE PRINT("NO")`

You can then type:

- `b + 1` <br>
and again: <br>

- `IF b == 5 THEN PRINT("True") ELSE PRINT("NO")` <br>
